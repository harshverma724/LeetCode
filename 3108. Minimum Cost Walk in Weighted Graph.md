#### Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph (LeetCode 3108)

## Problem Statement
There is an undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given the integer `n` and an array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `ui` and `vi` with a weight of `wi`.

A **walk** on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.

The **cost** of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined as the **bitwise AND** of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is `w0, w1, w2, ..., wk`, then the cost is calculated as:

```plaintext
w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk
```
where `&` denotes the **bitwise AND** operator.

You are also given a `query` array, where `query[i] = [si, ti]`. For each query, you need to find the **minimum cost** of the walk starting at vertex `si` and ending at vertex `ti`. If there exists no such walk, return `-1`.

Return the array `answer`, where `answer[i]` denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query `i`.

## Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]
Output: [1,-1]
```

**Explanation:**
- To achieve the cost of `1` in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `0->1 (7)`, `1->2 (1)`, `2->1 (1)`, `1->3 (7)`.
- In the second query, there is no walk between nodes `3` and `4`, so the answer is `-1`.

---

## Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]
Output: [0]
```

**Explanation:**
- To achieve the cost of `0` in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `1->2 (1)`, `2->1 (6)`, `1->2 (1)`.

---

## Constraints:
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `0 <= wi <= 10^5`
- `1 <= query.length <= 10^5`
- `query[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= si, ti <= n - 1`
- `si != ti`

## Solution Approach

### Key Idea:
1. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU)** is used to determine connected components.
2. Each component maintains a **bitwise AND** of all edges within it.
3. For each query, we check if `si` and `ti` are in the same component and return the precomputed AND cost.

## Code Implementation (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    int[] parent;
    int[] depth;

    public int[] minimumCost(int n, int[][] edges, int[][] queries) {
        parent = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = -1;

        depth = new int[n];
        int[] componentCost = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            componentCost[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            union(edge[0], edge[1]);
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int root = find(edge[0]);
            componentCost[root] &= edge[2];
        }

        int[] answer = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int start = queries[i][0];
            int end = queries[i][1];

            if (find(start) != find(end)) {
                answer[i] = -1;
            } else {
                int root = find(start);
                answer[i] = componentCost[root];
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }

    private int find(int node) {
        if (parent[node] == -1) return node;
        return parent[node] = find(parent[node]);
    }

    private void union(int node1, int node2) {
        int root1 = find(node1);
        int root2 = find(node2);

        if (root1 == root2) return;

        if (depth[root1] < depth[root2]) {
            int temp = root1;
            root1 = root2;
            root2 = temp;
        }

        parent[root2] = root1;

        if (depth[root1] == depth[root2]) {
            depth[root1]++;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Union-Find Operations:** `O(α(n))` per operation (almost constant time using path compression).
- **Building Components:** `O(E log E)`, since each union operation is nearly `O(1)`.
- **Processing Queries:** `O(Q)`, where `Q` is the number of queries.
- **Total Complexity:** `O(E + Q)`, which is efficient for large graphs.

---

## Summary
✅ **Uses Union-Find (DSU) for efficient component merging.**
✅ **Precomputes bitwise AND for connected components.**
✅ **Efficient `O(E + Q)` complexity for large graphs.**
✅ **Handles up to `10^5` nodes efficiently.**
