# Count Good Triplets

## Problem Description
This problem involves finding the number of "good triplets" in an array `arr` based on three integer thresholds `a`, `b`, and `c`. A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is considered "good" if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length` 
2. `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
3. `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
4. `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

Here, `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

### Examples:  

#### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr = [3, 0, 1, 1, 9, 7]`, `a = 7`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The good triplets are:
- `(3, 0, 1)`
- `(3, 0, 1)`
- `(3, 1, 1)`
- `(0, 1, 1)`

#### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 1`  
**Output:**  
`0`  
**Explanation:**  
No triplet satisfies all conditions.

## Logic of the Solution
The solution iterates through all possible triplets in the array and checks if they satisfy the given conditions. For each triplet `(i, j, k)` where `i < j < k`, we:
1. Check if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is less than or equal to `a`.
2. Check if the absolute difference between `arr[j]` and `arr[k]` is less than or equal to `b`.
3. Check if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[k]` is less than or equal to `c`.

If all these conditions are true, the triplet is counted as "good."

## Solution Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodTriplets(int[] arr, int a, int b, int c) {
        int n = arr.length, cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                    if (
                        Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a &&
                        Math.abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b &&
                        Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c
                    ) {
                        ++cnt;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The solution has a time complexity of **O(nÂ³)** because we use three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets in the array.

---

## Space Complexity
The solution has a space complexity of **O(1)** as it does not use any additional data structures, only a variable to count the number of good triplets.
