# Count Days Without Meetings

## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `days` representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array `meetings` of size `n` where `meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the starting and ending days of meeting `i` (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

**Note:** The meetings may overlap.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
```java
int days = 10;
int[][] meetings = {{5,7}, {1,3}, {9,10}};
```
#### Output:
```java
2
```
#### Explanation:
There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.

### Example 2:
#### Input:
```java
int days = 5;
int[][] meetings = {{2,4}, {1,3}};
```
#### Output:
```java
1
```
#### Explanation:
There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.

### Example 3:
#### Input:
```java
int days = 6;
int[][] meetings = {{1,6}};
```
#### Output:
```java
0
```
#### Explanation:
Meetings are scheduled for all working days.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= days <= 10^9`
- `1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5`
- `meetings[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days`

## Solution Approach
The solution uses a `TreeMap` to efficiently track the start and end of meetings while maintaining a prefix sum to count the free days. The approach is as follows:

1. **Initialize a TreeMap** to store increments and decrements of meeting schedules.
2. **Track the first meeting day** and count the initial free days before any meetings.
3. **Iterate through the sorted keys of the TreeMap** to determine the gaps where no meetings occur.
4. **Use a prefix sum technique** to efficiently determine the number of free days.
5. **Add any remaining free days** after the last meeting.

## Code Implementation
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countDays(int days, int[][] meetings) {
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> dayMap = new TreeMap<>();
        int prefixSum = 0, freeDays = 0, previousDay = days;

        for (int[] meeting : meetings) {
            previousDay = Math.min(previousDay, meeting[0]);
            dayMap.put(meeting[0], dayMap.getOrDefault(meeting[0], 0) + 1);
            dayMap.put(meeting[1] + 1, dayMap.getOrDefault(meeting[1] + 1, 0) - 1);
        }

        freeDays += (previousDay - 1);
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> day : dayMap.entrySet()) {
            int currentDay = day.getKey();
            if (prefixSum == 0) {
                freeDays += (currentDay - previousDay);
            }
            prefixSum += day.getValue();
            previousDay = currentDay;
        }

        freeDays += days - previousDay + 1;
        return freeDays;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of meetings. The sorting of keys in the `TreeMap` takes `O(n log n)`, and iterating through the map is `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, due to the storage of `TreeMap` elements.

## Usage
To use this solution, create an instance of `Solution` and call `countDays()` with the required inputs:
```java
Solution sol = new Solution();
int result = sol.countDays(10, new int[][]{{5,7},{1,3},{9,10}});
System.out.println(result); // Output: 2
```
