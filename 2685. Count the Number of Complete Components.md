# Count the Number of Complete Components

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`. There is an undirected graph with `n` vertices, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices `a_i` and `b_i`.

Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.

A **connected component** is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be **complete** if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

### Example 1:

#### Input:
```java
n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
```
#### Output:
```java
3
```
#### Explanation:
The graph contains three complete connected components.

### Example 2:

#### Input:
```java
n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
```
#### Output:
```java
1
```
#### Explanation:
Only one connected component is complete, as the component containing vertices `{3,4,5}` is not fully connected.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1`
- `a_i != b_i`
- No repeated edges.

## Solution Approach
The solution follows these steps:
1. **Build the Adjacency List:**
   - Create a list for each vertex and initialize it with itself.
   - Populate adjacency lists using the given edges.
2. **Use a Frequency Map to Track Component Patterns:**
   - Sort adjacency lists to detect unique connected components.
   - Maintain a frequency map to count occurrences of unique adjacency lists.
3. **Determine Complete Components:**
   - A component is complete if the number of nodes matches the number of connections.
   - Count such components and return the result.

## Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int countCompleteComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Adjacency lists for each vertex
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        // Map to store frequency of each unique adjacency list
        Map<List<Integer>, Integer> componentFreq = new HashMap<>();

        // Initialize adjacency lists with self-loops
        for (int vertex = 0; vertex < n; vertex++) {
            graph[vertex] = new ArrayList<>();
            graph[vertex].add(vertex);
        }

        // Build adjacency lists from edges
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }

        // Count frequency of each unique adjacency pattern
        for (int vertex = 0; vertex < n; vertex++) {
            List<Integer> neighbors = graph[vertex];
            Collections.sort(neighbors);
            componentFreq.put(
                neighbors,
                componentFreq.getOrDefault(neighbors, 0) + 1
            );
        }

        // Count complete components where size equals frequency
        int completeCount = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<List<Integer>, Integer> entry : componentFreq.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getKey().size() == entry.getValue()) {
                completeCount++;
            }
        }

        return completeCount;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Building the adjacency list:** `O(n + m)`, where `m` is the number of edges.
- **Sorting adjacency lists:** `O(n log n)`.
- **Tracking component frequency:** `O(n)`.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(n log n + m)`, which is efficient given the constraints.

---

## Alternative Approach
An alternative approach is to use **DFS** or **BFS** to detect connected components and check completeness.

---

## Usage
To run the solution, compile the Java file and call `countCompleteComponents(n, edges)`. The function will return the number of complete connected components.
