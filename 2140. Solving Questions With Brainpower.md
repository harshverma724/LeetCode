# Solving Questions With Brainpower (LeetCode 2140)

## Problem Statement
You are given a **0-indexed 2D integer array** `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question `i` will earn you `pointsi` points but you will be unable to solve each of the next `brainpoweri` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
```plaintext
questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
```
#### Output:
```plaintext
5
```
#### Explanation:
- Solve question 0: Earn `3` points, unable to solve questions `1` and `2`
- Solve question 3: Earn `2` points
- Total points: `3 + 2 = 5`

### Example 2:
#### Input:
```plaintext
questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
```
#### Output:
```plaintext
7
```
#### Explanation:
- Skip question `0`
- Solve question `1`: Earn `2` points
- Solve question `4`: Earn `5` points
- Total points: `2 + 5 = 7`

## Constraints:
- `1 <= questions.length <= 10^5`
- `questions[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 10^5`

## Solution (Java)
This problem can be solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)** with a bottom-up approach.

### Approach:
1. Define `dp[i]` as the maximum points obtainable starting from index `i`.
2. Iterate **backwards** from the last question to the first.
3. Choose between:
   - **Solving** the question and skipping `brainpower[i]` questions.
   - **Skipping** the question and taking `dp[i+1]`.
4. Store the maximum value in `dp[i]`.

### Code Implementation:
```java
class Solution {
    public long mostPoints(int[][] questions) {
        int n = questions.length;
        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int points = questions[i][0];
            int brainpower = questions[i][1];
            
            int nextQuestion = i + brainpower + 1;
            long solve = points + (nextQuestion < n ? dp[nextQuestion] : 0);
            long skip = dp[i + 1];
            
            dp[i] = Math.max(solve, skip);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, since we traverse the `questions` array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, for the `dp` array.

### Explanation:
- The DP array `dp[i]` stores the maximum points we can get starting from question `i`.
- At each question, we decide whether to solve or skip it.
- The final answer is `dp[0]`, which gives the maximum possible points from the start.

---

## Alternative Approach (Space Optimization)
Since `dp[i]` only depends on future values, we can reduce space complexity to `O(1)` by using two variables.
```java
class Solution {
    public long mostPoints(int[][] questions) {
        int n = questions.length;
        long next = 0, curr = 0;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int points = questions[i][0];
            int brainpower = questions[i][1];
            
            long solve = points + ((i + brainpower + 1 < n) ? next : 0);
            long skip = curr;
            
            next = curr;
            curr = Math.max(solve, skip);
        }
        
        return curr;
    }
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

---

## Summary
- This problem is a classic **Dynamic Programming** problem.
- A **bottom-up DP approach** works efficiently within the given constraints.
- Optimized approach reduces space complexity from `O(n)` to `O(1)`.
