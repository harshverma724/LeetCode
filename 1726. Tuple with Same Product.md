# Solution Approach for "Tuple with Same Product"

## Problem Overview

The problem asks to find the number of distinct tuples `(a, b, c, d)` in a given array of distinct positive integers `nums`, where:

- `a * b = c * d`, and
- All values in the tuple are distinct (`a != b != c != d`).

## Approach

### 1. **Calculate All Pairwise Products**

The first step is to generate all possible pairs `(a, b)` from the array `nums`. For each pair, we calculate the product `a * b`. This gives us potential candidates for products that we will later compare with other pairs.

### 2. **Count Occurrences of Each Product**

We store the frequency of each product in a **HashMap**. The key of the HashMap is the product, and the value is the count of how many times that product has appeared so far. This allows us to efficiently track how many pairs result in the same product.

- **Why a HashMap?**
  The HashMap allows us to quickly look up the frequency of any product and helps us keep track of the pair count in constant time.

### 3. **Valid Tuple Calculation**

Once we have the frequency of each product, we need to calculate the number of valid tuples. For every product that appears `k` times, we can form `k * (k - 1) / 2` distinct valid pairs of pairs. This formula comes from combinatorics and counts how many ways we can select two distinct pairs from `k` pairs.

However, for each valid tuple, there are **4 permutations** (since the tuple `(a, b, c, d)` can be rearranged in 4 different ways: `(a, b, c, d)`, `(a, c, b, d)`, `(a, d, b, c)`, and `(b, c, a, d)`).

Therefore, the total number of valid tuples for each product with `k` occurrences is:

k * (k - 1) * 4

### 4. **Edge Case Handling**

We ensure that we only consider products that appear more than once. If a product appears only once, it cannot form any valid tuple, so we skip it.

### 5. **Final Result**

The final result is the sum of valid tuples for all products. The value is returned as the total number of valid tuples `(a, b, c, d)` where `a * b = c * d` and `a != b != c != d`.

## Time Complexity

- **O(n²)**: We generate all pairs `(a, b)` in the array, and for each pair, we perform constant-time operations to update the HashMap.
  - This results in a time complexity of O(n²) because there are `n * (n - 1) / 2` pairs, where `n` is the length of the input array.

- **O(n²)**: We loop through the HashMap to count the number of valid tuples based on the product frequencies. In the worst case, this step is linear with respect to the number of unique products (which is bounded by n² for an array of size `n`).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n²)**, which is efficient enough for typical input sizes.

## Space Complexity

- **O(n²)**: The space complexity comes from storing all the pairwise products in the HashMap. In the worst case, there can be O(n²) unique products if the array contains distinct elements and the products do not repeat.
  
  Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n²)**.
